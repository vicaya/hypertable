To run this test do the following:
1. Copy entire dir to mothercompiler:<HT_INSTALL_DIR>
2. Run run.pl
3. Follow hyperspace recovery procedure
4. Run some queries/loads 

Hyperspace recovery procedure

Say you have three Hyperspace replicas running on "host[1-3].somedomain.com" respectively and the master replica which was running on host2 fails:

1. Run "cap stop" to stop the cluster
2. Login to one of the functioning servers which was running Hyperspace replica (in this case most likely host1 or host3) and run:
    /usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.8/bin/db_hotbackup -h <HYPERTABLE_INSTALL_DIR>/hyperspace/ -b hyperspace_snapshot
    tar -zcvf hyperspace_snapshot
3. Identify the new machine you want to use as a Hyperspace replica (say host4.somedomain.com)
4. Delete contents of "host4:/<HYPERTABLE_INSTALL_DIR>/hyperspace". Copy hyperspace_snapshot.tgz to host4:/<HYPERTABLE_INSTALL_DIR>/hyperspace/ & extract.
5. Modify your hypertable config file to remove host2 and add host4 under the property Hyperspace.Replica.Host .
6. Modify hypertable config file to replace host2 with host 4 in case it was set as Hypertable.Master.Host
7. Modify the Capfile list of hyperspace servers to replace host2 with host4 and master server in case host2 was the master.
8. Run "cap dist" to distribute the new config file through the cluster
9. Run "cap start"
